# Graphing Calculator Project

This project is a Java-based graphing calculator application that allows users to plot various mathematical functions and equations on a graph.

## Features
- **Calculator Functions** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, braces, order of operations, and decimals.
- **Graphing Functions:** Supports linear, absolute, parabolic, square root, cubic, reciprocal, sine, cosine, and tangent functions.
- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface to input equations and view graphs.
- **Music Player:** Includes a music player feature to play songs and display song progress.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Installation
